This is a project-WeatCollection basically developed for anaj mandi where in this project we can manage operators who oprate the software from three place/counter,
on first counter from where farmer's tractor trolley enters to mandi premises where operator 1 will logging in with their credentials, operator 1 will registering 
new farmer if unregistered farmer will be there, or search existing farmer and generate token for them, now farmer will approach to 2nd counter which would be 
placed near of big weighing scale for vehicles they weight the whole tractor trolley with their grain, operator 2 will enter the weight in software, 
farmes now goes to counter 3 for dropping the material, operator 2 will submiting the entry which is a tick/check mark in software which means material is dropped to
mandi premises so as operator 2 can ensures that the trolley must unloaded in mandi premises, after that farmer's tractor trolley approaches to counter 2 and weight 
their vehicle and operator to will enter the empty trolley's weight, so that net weight could be calculated, then farmer can leave the premises.

In this software operator 1,2 and 3 have limited access according to their work and admin have all the access where he can change, update or register new operator.

this project developed by using java AWT, Swing, and my sql is used for database, i have put the mandi SQL.sql file for database.
